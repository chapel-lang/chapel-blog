  The Chapel community is excited to announce the release of Chapel
  2.5!  As always, you can [download and
  install](https://chapel-lang.org/download/) it in a {{<sidenote
  "right" "variety of formats">}}Note that some formats may not be
  immediately available on the day of the release...{{</sidenote>}},
  including Spack, Docker, Homebrew, various Linux package managers,
  and good old source tarballs.

  In this article, we'll introduce some of the highlights of Chapel
  2.5, including:

  * A new [distributed sort](#distributed-sorting) algorithm that
    outperforms and outscales previous sorts in Chapel

  * A new concept of [editions](#chapel-editions) to support
    experimental and potentially breaking features

  * A new version of the [`reshape()`](#aliasing-array-reshaping)
    procedure that supports aliasing of local arrays

  * Initial support for [debugging Chapel programs](#improved-debugging)
    using VS Code

  * Improvements to the capabilities and performance of the [Dyno
    front-end](#improvements-to-the-dyno-compiler-front-end)

  In addition to the above features, which are covered in more detail
  in the sections below, other highlights of Chapel 2.5 include:

  * Initial support for [dynamically loading
    libraries](https://chapel-lang.org/docs/2.5/modules/packages/DynamicLoading.html) and calling into them

  * Additional improvements to Chapel's support for [Python
    interoperability](https://chapel-lang.org/docs/2.5/modules/packages/Python.html)

  * A new technical note on [performance
    tuning](https://chapel-lang.org/docs/2.5/technotes/optimization.html)
    of Chapel programs

  * A new option to use
    [mimalloc](https://github.com/microsoft/mimalloc) as the memory
    allocator for
    [executables](https://chapel-lang.org/docs/2.5/usingchapel/chplenv.html#chpl-target-mem)
    or [the compiler
    itself](https://chapel-lang.org/docs/2.5/usingchapel/chplenv.html#chpl-host-mem)

  For a much more complete list of changes in Chapel 2.5, see the
  [CHANGES.md](https://github.com/chapel-lang/chapel/blob/release/2.5/CHANGES.md)
  file.  And huge thanks to [everyone who
  contributed](https://github.com/chapel-lang/chapel/blob/release/2.5/CONTRIBUTORS.md)
  to version 2.5!

  ### Distributed Sorting

  Chapel 2.5 includes a new implementation of scalable distributed
  sorting.  This implementation supports comparison- and radix-sorting
  of Block-distributed arrays, and it can be called from the standard
  library `sort()` procedure. When sorting random integers on 128
  nodes of HPE Cray EX, the new implementation is ~5x faster than the
  previous (undocumented) distributed radix sort in the standard
  library, and ~2x faster than the radix sort used in
  [Arkouda](https://arkouda-www.github.io/) to implement its GroupBy
  operations.

  {{< figure src="./sort.jpg" caption="A performance comparison between the new sort implementation, Arkouda's custom sort, and the previous (undocumented) distributed sort." class="fullwide" >}}

  To make use of this new sort implementation, simply pass a
  Block-distributed array to Chapel's standard
  [`sort()`](https://chapel-lang.org/docs/2.5/modules/standard/Sort.html#Sort.sort) procedure.

  ### Chapel Editions

  The [Chapel 2.0 release]({{<relref announcing-chapel-2.0>}})
  represented a promise that we wouldn't make breaking changes to the
  language willy-nilly.  But there are still breaking changes we will
  need to make, both to improve upon existing features, and to address
  future requests from users.  With that in mind, Chapel 2.5 includes
  a new _editions_ feature that takes its inspiration from Rust.

  Chapel's editions provide a known stable version of the language via
  the default 2.0 edition.  They also provide a place for trying out
  proposed changes via a new {{<sidenote "right" "_pre-edition_">}}Note that
  in the 2.6 release this edition will be named "preview" instead.  This was a
  name that occurred to us after the release or it would have been the name for
  2.5.  Sorry for the churn!{{</sidenote>}}.  Users will get the 2.0
  edition by default; or they can explicitly request it by compiling
  with the new edition flag, using<br> `--edition=2.0`.  Meanwhile, users
  who want to experiment with anticipated breaking changes can compile
  with `--edition=pre-edition`, though we do not recommend
  distributing production code with this setting.

  As of Chapel 2.5, the pre-edition only contains a revision to the
  `reshape()` procedure, as described in the next section.  Going
  forward, we intend to add other breaking changes to the pre-edition
  as they come up.  Once we have accumulated enough changes—and have
  enough experience with them—we will make a new official edition that
  bundles those changes.  Please continue to make suggestions on how
  to improve the language via [Github
  issues](https://github.com/chapel-lang/chapel/issues) or one of our
  various [communication
  platforms](https://chapel-lang.org/community/).

  For more information on editions in Chapel, please refer to their
  [technical
  note](https://chapel-lang.org/docs/2.5/technotes/editions.html).


  ### Aliasing Array Reshaping

  Though Chapel has long supported the ability to reshape an array
  from one rank and/or shape to another, this has always been done by
  copying the array's elements.  Thus, if a user were to write:

*/

var A = [1, 2, 3, 4],
    B2D = reshape(A, {1..2, 1..2});

B2D[1, 1] = 5;

/*

  the assignment to `B2D` wouldn't change the values of `A`'s
  elements, since `B2D` would have its own copies of them.

  Users have long requested the ability to have a reshape procedure
  that results in an alias to the original array's elements rather
  than a copy.  In Chapel 2.5, we have added support for this feature,
  making it part of the pre-edition mentioned above, due to it being a
  breaking change relative to Chapel 2.0.

  In order to get an aliasing reshape, it is crucial that the result
  of the reshape be captured in a `ref` declaration or passed to a
  `ref` argument.  For example, rewriting the previous example as
  follows and compiling with `--edition=pre-edition` demonstrates that
  the original array `A` has been modified through the assignment to
  `A2D`:

*/

ref A2D = reshape(A, {1..2, 1..2});
A2D[1, 2] = 6;
  
writeln(A);  // prints '1 6 3 4'

/*

  Note that, at present, alias-based reshaping is only supported for
  local arrays since it isn't obvious that aliasing reshapes make
  sense for distributed array types.  To reshape a distributed array,
  an optional `copy=true` argument can be provided to opt back in to
  the copy-based behavior that Chapel has traditionally provided.

  This new version of `reshape()` also has some quality-of-life
  improvements, such as:

  * permitting the new shape to be specified as a list of ranges
    (e.g., `reshape(A, 1..2, 1..2)`),

  * inferring the upper bound when reshaping to a 1D array (e.g.,
    `reshape(A, 1..)`), and

  * flagging likely mistakes when dimensions are fragmented or
    combined in surprising ways.

  For details, refer to the [online
  documentation](https://chapel-lang.org/docs/2.5/language/spec/arrays.html#ChapelArray.reshape)
  for `reshape()`.

  ### Improved Debugging

  Chapel 2.5 includes significant improvements to debugging support,
  making it easier to identify and resolve issues in your code.
  Historically, Chapel has had limited debugging capabilities, which
  has been a barrier for many users, especially those accustomed to
  more robust debugging tools in other languages.

  This release addresses some of these challenges by expanding the
  Chapel VS Code extension to better support shared-memory
  debugging. This makes it much easier to visually debug Chapel
  programs.

  {{< figure src="debug.png" caption="A screenshot of debugging Chapel from within VS Code" class="fullwide" >}}

  The limited debugging support that Chapel has traditionally had has
  been geared toward the compiler's C back end. This usually meant
  debugging Chapel code in terms of C code and C variables, which is
  cumbersome.

  In an ideal world, Chapel variables and structures would be directly
  accessible in a debugger without any use or knowledge of C. This
  release moves Chapel towards this vision by having the compiler
  generate better debug information when using the default LLVM back
  end. Although further improvements are still needed, Chapel 2.5
  represents a tangible improvement on the road to a more seamless
  debugging experience in Chapel.

  To learn more about these improvements, see the new [Debugging in VS
  Code](https://chapel-lang.org/docs/2.5/usingchapel/editor-support.html#debugging-in-vscode)
  section in the editor documentation.

  ### Improvements to the Dyno Compiler Front End

  As you may have seen in [previous]({{< relref
  "announcing-chapel-2.4#dyno-support-for-chapel-features" >}})
  [release]({{< relref
  "announcing-chapel-2.3#dyno-compiler-improvements" >}})
  [announcements]({{< relref
  "announcing-chapel-1.31#scope-resolution-and-errors-by-dyno" >}}), _Dyno_
  is the name of a project whose aim is to modernize and improve the
  Chapel compiler. Dyno improves error messages, allows incremental
  type resolution, and enables the [development of language
  tooling]({{< relref "chapel-py" >}}).  Among the major wins for this
  ongoing effort is the [Chapel Language Server
  (CLS)](https://chapel-lang.org/docs/2.5/tools/chpl-language-server/chpl-language-server.html),
  which was previously featured in a [blog post about editor
  integration]({{< relref "chapel-lsp" >}}).  Our team has been hard
  at work implementing many features of Chapel's type system in Dyno,
  which---among other things---will enable tools like CLS to
  provide more accurate and helpful information to users.

  #### More Language Features

  This release has seen additional support for language features come online
  with Dyno, where some notable examples include:
    - ``reduce=`` expressions
    - array indexing and slicing
    - n-dimensional array literals
    - de-tupling loop indices

  The following screenshot shows an editing session in which
  Dyno-inferred type information is rendered in-line within the
  following, mostly untyped, code example.

  {{< file_download_min fname="reduce-index-nd.chpl" lang="chapel" >}}

  {{< figure src="./dyno-lang-features.png" alt="Dyno displaying inferred type information for n-dimensional arrays, reduce=, and tuples." caption="Dyno displaying inferred type information for n-dimensional arrays, ``reduce=``, and tuples" class="fullwide" >}}


  #### Generating Executable Code

  This release also includes experimental support for using Dyno to generate
  executable code, which is a major step toward Dyno's goal of replacing
  the front end of the production compiler. This is an ongoing process that involves taking
  the information that Dyno has about the program and generating AST for
  the production compiler, essentially skipping over its
  type resolution and analysis phases. This capability is enabled using the
  ``--dyno`` command-line flag.

  Initial support is limited to a subset of Chapel's language
  features, but will grow over time. Here is a simple example program
  that Dyno can now compile, demonstrating the use of extern blocks
  and the ``c_ptr`` type:

  {{< file_download fname="converter-simple.chpl" lang="chapel" >}}

  Dyno can also compile additional features into executables,
  including enums, select-statements, and others.  Stay tuned as we
  continue to add support for more features!


  #### Improvements to Compile Times

  In addition to improving Dyno's resolver and converter, a lot
  of effort has been dedicated in this release to Dyno's performance.
  Using algorithmic improvements, better data structures, and strategic
  caching, the team was able to reduce the time it takes Dyno to
  resolve programs by as much as 5x in some cases. Though Dyno has not
  yet achieved full support for all Chapel features, our recent
  experiments put it ahead of the production compiler in terms of
  resolution speed:

  {{< details summary="**(Click to see the motivating example program)**" >}}
  ```chapel
  use BlockDist;

  proc test() {
    var D = {1..10, 1..10};
    var b = new blockDist(D);
  }

  test();
  ```
  {{< /details >}}

  Since Dyno powers the [Chapel Language Server (CLS)](https://chapel-lang.org/docs/tools/chpl-language-server/chpl-language-server.html),
  these performance improvements will be reflected in the form of faster diagnostics and type-based
  hints in any editor that uses the Language Server Protocol -- including
  VS Code. Coincidentally, since Dyno's stability has improved since the
  initial release of resolver-based LSP features, in Chapel 2.5 we've enabled
  resolution-based diagnostics in CLS. Not only will you have more information
  in your editor, but you'll also have it faster than before.

  This short summary doesn't begin to cover
  {{< sidenote "right" "all the Dyno improvements that have been made" >}}
  Over 46 PRs have been merged as part of the Dyno project since the last release.
  {{< /sidenote >}} since version 2.4. With each release, Dyno draws nearer to
  feature parity with the production compiler.
