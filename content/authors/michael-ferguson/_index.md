Michael Ferguson is a principal software engineer at HPE within the
Chapel team. He focuses primarily on improving the Chapel language and
its compiler, and he has worked in many areas of the Chapel project; from
LLVM-based code generation to I/O support. He's currently the technical
leader of an effort to dramatically improve the compiler, including
making it more interactive and reducing compile times.

Michael is also the the primary author of
[FEMTO](https://github.com/femto-dev/femto), an indexing and search
system built with compressed suffix arrays and a whole lot of sorting.
