Andy is a compiler developer at HPE for the Chapel programming language.  His
primary contributions to Chapel involve work related to GPU support and leading
a subteam to investigate, maintain, and report on Chapel performance.  He holds
a Ph.D. from Colorado State University where he studied compilers and high
performance computing.  

Andy interned for the Chapel team (then at Cray Inc.) in 2008, returning 13
years later, to join full-time, after completing his Ph.D. and spending several
years working on a MATLAB-to-C/C++ compiler.  Andy is also father to two twin
daughters, which gives him ample opportunities to practice parallel processing
in his personal life.
