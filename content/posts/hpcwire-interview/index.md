This summer, I sat down with Doug Eadline of HPCwire to answer some
questions about Chapel and bring their readers up-to-date on our
recent progress.  The resulting interview was published on the
[HPCWire
website](https://www.hpcwire.com/2024/09/04/whats-new-with-chapel-nine-questions-for-the-development-team/)
on September 4th, 2024.
