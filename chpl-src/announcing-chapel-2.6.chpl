  The Chapel community is pleased to announce the release of Chapel
  2.6!  As usual, you can [download and
  install](https://chapel-lang.org/download/) this new version in a
  {{<sidenote "right" "variety of formats">}}Note that some formats
  may not be immediately available on the day of the
  release...{{</sidenote>}}, including Spack, Docker, Homebrew,
  various Linux package managers, and good-old source tarballs.

  In this article, we'll introduce some of the highlights of Chapel
  2.6, including:

  * Chapel's new module for [dynamically loading
    libraries](#dynamic-loading-support) and calling into them

  * Improvements when [debugging Chapel programs](#debugging-enhancements)

  * Improved [unit
    testing](#unit-testing-improvements-for-mason-and-vscode) with
    Mason and VSCode

  * Numerous [documentation and
    `chpldoc`](#documentation-improvements) improvements

  * Improvements to the capabilities of the [Dyno compiler
    front-end](#improvements-to-the-dyno-compiler-front-end)


  In addition to the above features, each of which is covered in more
  detail below, other highlights of Chapel 2.6 include:

  * Improved support for using [address
    sanitizers](https://chapel-lang.org/docs/2.6/usingchapel/debugging/sanitizers.html)
    with Chapel programs

  * Ongoing capability improvements to Chapel's tools, such as
    [VSCode](https://chapel-lang.org/docs/2.6/usingchapel/editor-support.html#vscode),
    the [`chplcheck`](https://chapel-lang.org/docs/2.6/tools/chplcheck/chplcheck.html) linter,
    [`chpl-language-server`](https://chapel-lang.org/docs/2.6/tools/chpl-language-server/chpl-language-server.html), and [`chapel-py`](https://chapel-lang.org/docs/2.6/tools/chapel-py/chapel-py.html)

  * Flexibility improvements to the
    [Homebrew](https://chapel-lang.org/download/#homebrew) and [Linux
    package](https://chapel-lang.org/download/#linux) releases of
    Chapel, including support for:
    - Chapel's cpu-as-device GPU emulation mode
    - support for multi-locale executions with Homebrew installs
    - support for both the LLVM and C-based back-ends in Linux
      packages

    In addition, where past Linux packages supported a binary download
    per Chapel configuration, the 2.6 release bundles all
    configurations for a given OS/platform into a single binary.

  For a much more complete list of changes in Chapel 2.6, see the
  [CHANGES.md](https://github.com/chapel-lang/chapel/blob/release/2.6/CHANGES.md)
  file.  And as always, thanks to [everyone who
  contributed](https://github.com/chapel-lang/chapel/blob/release/2.6/CONTRIBUTORS.md)
  to version 2.6!


  ### Dynamic Loading Support

  This release of Chapel offers improved support for calling
  procedures from dynamically loaded libraries.  This feature was
  introduced in a prototypical form for the 2.5 release, but in 2.6 it
  is now supported by all compiler back-ends and has improved
  stability.

  To use this feature, you must first have a shared library that you
  wish to dynamically load.  As a simple example, we'll create and
  call into a toy library defined as follows:

{{<file_download fname="MyAdd.c" lang="C">}}

  The compiler invocation to create a dynamic library from the C code
  above should look something like the following, where details may
  vary depending on your C compiler and platform:


  ```console
  $ clang -shared -fPIC -o libMyAdd.so MyAdd.c
  ```


  Once your library is compiled, you can write a program to load it
  and call `myAdd()` with just a few lines of Chapel code:

*/

use DynamicLoading;

const lib = binary.load('./libMyAdd.so'),
      add = lib.retrieve('myAdd', proc(x: int, y: int): int);

const n = add(2, 2);
writeln(n);

/*

  Note that although `bin.retrieve()` was only called on `Locales[0]`,
  the retrieved procedure stored in `add` can be invoked on any
  locale:

*/

on Locales.last {
  const n = add(here.id, here.id);
  writeln(n);
}

/*

  In order to use dynamic loading in Chapel at present, the
  `useProcedurePointers` `config param` must be set to `true` during
  Chapel compilation (this requirement will be relaxed in future
  releases).  As a result, to compile this example and run it on four
  locales, you could use:

  ```console
   $ chpl -suseProcedurePointers=true UseMyAdd.chpl
   $ ./UseMyAdd -nl 4
   4
   6
  ```

  In addition to supporting traditional shared libraries like this
  sample C library, this feature also provides initial support for
  loading and calling into dynamic Chapel libraries whose exported
  procedures are pure and C-likeâ€”for example, ones that don't rely on
  Chapel's runtime or modules.  In future releases, we plan to expand
  loading of dynamic libraries to support arbitrary Chapel procedures.


  ### Debugging Enhancements

  Debugging Chapel programs gets even better in version 2.6, with
  better debug information and new pretty-printers.  Historically,
  debugging Chapel programs has meant interacting with the generated C
  code.  This meant that when inspecting Chapel variables, you would
  see the internal C representation of those data structures.  In this
  release, we added pretty-printers for LLDB when using Chapel's C
  back-end that make it possible to view Chapel data structures using
  formats that are much more intuitive and user-oriented.  This
  improvement can be seen in the following sample debugging session
  involving arrays.

  In this example, we'll debug the following simple Chapel program:

  {{<file_download fname="example.chpl" lang="Chapel">}}

  We have used the
  [`Debugger`](https://chapel-lang.org/docs/modules/standard/Debugger.html)
  module's `breakpoint` statement to automatically stop execution at
  the place of interest in our program when running within a debugger.
  To compile this program and run it within LLDB, we use {{<sidenote
  "right" "the following commands">}}Note that we are working on a
  more ergonomic way to disable optimizations and code transformations
  when debugging, to avoid the list of flags shown here.  This is
  being discussed in issue
  [#27615](https://github.com/chapel-lang/chapel/issues/27615){{</sidenote>}}
  in a configuration that uses Chapel's C back-end
  (e.g.,&nbsp;`CHPL_TARGET_COMPILER=clang`):

  ```console
  $ chpl -g --no-copy-propagation --no-scalar-replacement --no-denormalize --no-munge-user-idents example.chpl
  $ ./example --lldb
  ```

  Upon running the program, we hit the `breakpoint` statement and can
  print out the contents of `myArr`.  Traditionally, that output would
  have looked like this:

  {{< figure class="fullwide" src="debug-old.png" >}}

  What we see is a bunch of internal C pointers that are used to
  implement Chapel arrays.  This isn't very helpful to the typical
  user, since it looks nothing like the logical array they'd expect.

  Now let's look at the exact same debugging session using the new
  pretty-printers added in Chapel 2.6:

  {{< figure class="fullwide" src="debug.png" >}}

  Now we see the contents of the array printed in a much more familiar
  and useful way, and the implementation details we don't care about
  {{<sidenote "right" " are hidden">}}If these details are important
  to you, you can still see them by printing the raw data structure
  using `v -R`.{{</sidenote>}}. This is just one example of the new
  pretty-printers, which cover a wide variety of built-in Chapel
  types, including strings, tuples, ranges, and domains. These new
  pretty-printers are available by default as long as you are using
  LLDB with Python support enabled.

  We also made some great improvements to the debug information that
  the Chapel compiler generates. The best example of this is with
  `enum`s. The debugger now has enough information to print out the
  names of the enum symbols instead of the underlying integer
  values. This makes it much easier to understand what is going on in
  your program. These improvements also lay the groundwork for
  additional improvements in the future.

  #### Prototype Parallel Debugger

  The Chapel 2.6 release also includes a new tool,
  `chpl-parallel-dbg`. This tool enables vastly improved debugging of
  multilocale Chapel programs, which has been a longstanding
  challenge. It works by launching a debugger on each locale of a
  Chapel program, and then connecting them all together with a single
  interface.

  In the following example, we'll demonstrate the use of
  `chpl-parallel-dbg` on this multilocale Chapel program:

  {{<file_download fname="multiloc/example.chpl" lang="Chapel">}}

  This session shows the program running on two locales, where we
  switch between them using a custom `on` command that mirrors the
  Chapel syntax.  To get each locale running, we use a `c` (continue)
  command, and then are notified once we hit one of the breakpoints.
  Note that the `up` command is performed automatically for us by the
  tooling to ensure that we're in the user-level Chapel code.

  {{< figure class="fullwide" src="parallel-dbg.png" >}}


  This new tool is still a work in progress, but it's already a huge
  step forward for debugging multilocale Chapel programs.  To learn
  more about it or to try it yourself, see [its
  documentation](https://chapel-lang.org/docs/2.6/usingchapel/debugging/multilocale.html#chpl-parallel-dbg).
  We are excited to continue improving this tool in future releases.


  ### Unit testing Improvements for Mason and VSCode

  This release also includes many significant improvements to
  [`mason`](https://chapel-lang.org/docs/2.6/tools/mason/mason.html),
  Chapel's package manager, primarily focused on improving the
  developer experience when testing.  We fixed many bugs with mason
  itself and added some new testing features.  For example, suppose we
  have a simple program defining some unit tests:

  {{<file_download fname="myTest.chpl" lang="Chapel">}}


  This can be run, standalone, using:

  ```console
  $ chpl myTest.chpl
  $ ./myTest
  ```

  However, using `mason` we can just run:

  ```console
   $ mason test myTest.chpl
  ```

  and it will handle compilation and execution, while also generating
  a nice report for us:

  ```text
  
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Ran 2 tests in 18.6117 seconds
  
  OK (passed = 2 )
  ```


  Chapel 2.6 also adds the ability to selectively run tests by name.
  For example, this command:

  ```console
   $ mason test myTest.chpl --filter myTest1
  ```

  will only run the `myTest1` test.  This is particularly useful when
  you are working on a specific test and don't want to run the entire
  suite.

  We also integrated testing into VSCode, so that you can run (and in
  the future, debug) tests directly from the editor!

  {{< figure class="fullwide" src="vscode-test.png" >}}

  This creates a much smoother workflow for developing and testing
  Chapel code from the comfort of a GUI.


  ### Documentation Improvements

  Each Chapel release typically includes a handful of documentation
  improvements, usually motivated by the features being added or
  improved during that release cycle.  This release cycle saw a larger
  than normal set of documentation improvements, due to _documentation
  week_.  This was a dedicated week focused on improving documentation
  and documentation-adjacent aspects of the project.  We frequently
  find it healthy to dedicate a week shortly after each release to
  focus on some housekeeping task.  Instead of juggling these
  important, ongoing efforts with other priorities, it allows us to
  make rapid progress in a short period of time, and also feels like
  a nice break from normal work.  Past dedicated weeks have focused
  specifically on cleaning up nightly testing or resolving user
  issues, and for this release it made sense to focus on
  documentation.

  During documentation week, we resolved and closed 23 outstanding
  issues.  We fixed bugs with our `chpldoc` documentation tool and
  added the ability to search our online documentation for compiler
  flags (like [this
  search](https://chapel-lang.org/docs/2.6/search.html?q=--fast&check_keywords=yes&area=default)
  for `--fast`).  As part of refactoring our [multilocale
  documentation](https://chapel-lang.org/docs/2.6/usingchapel/multilocale.html),
  we added or extended pages on using the [Elastic Fabric Adapter
  (EFA)](https://chapel-lang.org/docs/2.6/platforms/networks/efa.html)
  network interface for
  [AWS](https://chapel-lang.org/docs/2.6/platforms/aws.html#readme-aws),
  [Ethernet
  clusters](https://chapel-lang.org/docs/2.6/platforms/networks/ethernet.html),
  and [GASNet's SMP
  conduit](https://chapel-lang.org/docs/2.6/platforms/comm-layers/gasnet.html#readme-gasnet-smp)
  for running multiple locales on shared memory.  Additionally, this
  release saw the introduction of documentation on [sanitizer
  tools](https://chapel-lang.org/docs/2.6/usingchapel/debugging/sanitizers.html),
  and general improvements to our [debugging
  documentation](https://chapel-lang.org/docs/2.6/usingchapel/debugging.html).

  We also made extensive progress in updating code examples in
  documentation to support nightly testing.  Our enthusiasm for this
  effort carried over into subsequent weeks, such that for version
  2.6, we ultimately added testing for examples in 45 libraries and 9
  technotes!  As a result, we were able to identify and fix many
  examples that had gotten out-of-date due to improvements to the
  language.

  As a result of all these efforts, Chapel's online documentation is
  now more searchable, more accurate, and more robust to future
  changes; and `chpldoc` itself is better than ever!


  ### Improvements to the Dyno Compiler Front-End

  As you may have seen in [previous]({{< relref
  "announcing-chapel-2.5#improvements-to-the-dyno-compiler-front-end"
  >}}) [release]({{< relref
  "announcing-chapel-2.4#dyno-support-for-chapel-features" >}})
  [announcements]({{< relref
  "announcing-chapel-2.3#dyno-compiler-improvements" >}}), _Dyno_ is
  the name of our effort to modernize and improve the Chapel compiler.
  Dyno improves error messages, allows incremental type resolution,
  and enables the [development of language tooling]({{< relref
  "chapel-py" >}}).  Among the major wins for this ongoing effort is
  the [Chapel Language Server
  (CLS)](https://chapel-lang.org/docs/2.6/tools/chpl-language-server/chpl-language-server.html),
  which was previously featured in a [blog post about editor
  integration]({{< relref "chapel-lsp" >}}), not to mention Chapel's
  linter, VSCode support, and `chpldoc`.

  Our team has been hard at work implementing many features of
  Chapel's type system in Dyno, which---among other things---will
  enable tools like CLS to provide more accurate and helpful
  information to users.  In the 2.6 release, we have continued to
  improve Dyno's support for Chapel's language features, and we've
  also expanded the compiler's ability to leverage the Dyno front-end
  to generate executable code.

  #### More Language Features

  This release includes new support for resolving additional language
  features with Dyno, where some notable examples include:
  * various aspects of `enum`s, including casting and iteration
  * promotion, particularly with methods and compiler-generated operations
  * type queries, particularly for tuples and variadic formal arguments

  The following screenshot shows an editing session in which
  Dyno-inferred type information is rendered in-line when editing the
  following code example.

  {{< file_download_min fname="enum-aspects.chpl" lang="chapel" >}}

  {{< figure class="fullwide" src="./dyno-enum-aspects.png" alt="Dyno displaying inferred type information for `enum` casts, access, and iteration">}}

  There's a lot going on here!  As can be seen in the inferred type
  of `color1`, Dyno now supports casting `param` (compile-time
  constant) strings to `enum` values.  The inferred type of `color2`
  demonstrates accessing an `enum` constant (`blue` in this case) via
  a type alias (`myColorAlias`).  Finally, `index1` stores the numeric
  value computed for `cyan`, which Dyno now correctly infers to be
  `13`.

  The most involved example is the `for param` loop.  Chapel's
  semantics allow for compile-time iteration over certain ranges,
  which effectively completely unrolls the loop.  Dyno, like the
  production compiler, now supports iteration over ranges of `enum`s
  (in addition to ranges of integers).  Moreover, Dyno properly
  handles complex patterns of iteration, such as those that use the
  count operator (`#`) and the stride specification `by -2`.  The
  compiler warnings generated within the loop body show the values
  that `c` takes on during the unrolling of the loop.

  In this next example, you can see the improvements to Dyno's support
  for
  [promotion](https://chapel-lang.org/docs/2.6/users-guide/datapar/promotion.html).

  {{< file_download_min fname="promotion.chpl" lang="chapel" >}}

  {{< figure class="fullwide" src="./dyno-promotion.png" alt="Dyno displaying inferred type information for various promoted calls">}}

  Here, we re-use the `myColor` enumeration type.  We define a new
  method on this `enum`, called `someMethod`, then invoke this method
  on an array of colors, `A`.  Since this method produces a tuple of a
  string and an integer, applying it element-wise to the array `A`
  results in an array of tuples, which is the type that Dyno infers
  for `B`.  Chapel's compiler auto-generates casts from `enum`s to
  their specified `int` values where possible; in the example, we also
  apply this cast element-wise to `A`, resulting in an array of
  integers, which is the type that Dyno infers for `C`.


  #### Generating Executable Code

  This release also saw improvements to our support for using
  Dyno to generate executable code, which is a major step toward
  Dyno's goal of replacing the front-end of the production
  compiler. This is an ongoing process that involves taking the
  information that Dyno has computed about the program and generating
  AST for the production compiler, essentially skipping over its
  historical type resolution and analysis phases. This capability is
  enabled using the ``--dyno`` command-line flag.

  Initial support is limited to a subset of Chapel's language
  features, but is growing all the time.  Here is an example program
  and helper module that Dyno can now compile, demonstrating uses of
  classes, records, and strings:

  {{< file_download fname="converter-aggregates.chpl" lang="chapel" >}}

  {{< file_download_min fname="Print.chpl" lang="chapel" >}}

  Stay tuned as we continue to add support for more features to Dyno!
