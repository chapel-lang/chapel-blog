  The Chapel developer community is proud to announce the release of
  Chapel version 1.33!  Highlights of this release include brand new
  tools, broader support for co-locales, and further steps toward
  Chapel 2.0.  As always, to obtain a copy, see the [Downloading
  Chapel](https://chapel-lang.org/download.html) page on the Chapel
  website.

  ### Highlights of Chapel 1.33

  #### Our Next Release Candidate for Chapel 2.0

  Continuing from where we left off in September, Chapel 1.33
  constitutes our next (and potentially final?) release candidate for
  Chapel 2.0.  If the Chapel 2.0 concept is new to you, be sure to
  check out our [September release announcement]({{< relref
  "announcing-chapel-1.32/index.md#chapel-20-release-candidate" >}})
  for an introduction.

  For 1.33, we have updated Chapel's [binary
  serializer](https://chapel-lang.org/docs/1.33/modules/standard/IO.html#IO.binarySerializer)
  to address user concerns about the way certain types were being
  represented in version 1.32.  Specifically, that release replaced
  our legacy binary IO capability with a serialization-based approach
  and, in doing so, made some changes to certain types by having them
  embed additional structure, like the length of a string/bytes value,
  or whether or not a class variable was storing `nil`.  This
  additional meta-data was unpopular with users, causing us to back
  out those elements and revert to having binary serialization use an
  unstructured format.  Meanwhile, for those who preferred the
  additional structure, we moved that support into a new
  ['ObjectSerialization'](https://chapel-lang.org/docs/1.33/modules/packages/ObjectSerialization.html)
  package that we intend to make even more sophisticated and capable
  over time—e.g., capable of checkpointing and restoring complex data
  structures.
  
  The other major stabilization-related improvement in Chapel 1.33 is
  a significant clean-up to the ['Random'
  module](https://chapel-lang.org/docs/1.33/modules/standard/Random.html),
  which was considered unstable in version 1.32 due to lack of time
  and recent attention.  In version 1.33, we have moved the antiquated
  NPB random number generator out into [a new package
  module](https://chapel-lang.org/docs/1.33/modules/packages/NPBRandom.html)
  and streamlined other aspects of the `Random` interface, removing
  the blanket unstable warning.  Additional improvements are still in
  the works, and we currently expect the `Random` module to be stable
  in the next release.

  At present, Chapel 2.0 is slated to be released in March 2024,
  barring surprises or an outpouring of user concerns with version
  1.33.  As with version 1.32, we encourage users who are relying on
  Chapel to let us know whether there are aspects of its current
  definition that they feel uneasy stabilizing as-is.  For further
  information on how you can help us with this effort, please refer to
  Lydia Duncan's [recent call to
  action](https://developer.hpe.com/blog/help-us-prioritize-features-for-future-releases-of-chapel/)
  on the [HPE Developer blog](https://developer.hpe.com/blog/).



  #### New Tools

  Chapel 1.33 features three new tools that users may be interested in
  incorporating into their workflow.

  The first of these was developed to support the request for user
  feedback mentioned just above.  It can be used to summarize the
  unstable features that a Chapel program is using in an anonymized
  way.  Our hope is that this will simplify the process of having
  users take stock of which unstable features they're using, allowing
  them to either advocate for them to be stabilized sooner, or to
  switch to more stable features.  For more information about how to
  apply this tool to your programs, please see [its
  documentation](https://chapel-lang.org/docs/1.33/tools/unstableWarningAnonymizer/unstableWarningAnonymizer.html).
  And, as a fun fact: this tool is written in Chapel itself!

  The next tool is `chplcheck`, a prototype linter that checks Chapel
  code against a number of style rules, many of which reflect
  conventions that we have been adopting within our standard modules
  as part of the Chapel 2.0 stabilization process.  The various rules
  can be disabled or enabled, so that you can pick a mix of them that
  correlate to the style you've adopted for your Chapel project.  For
  convenience, `chplcheck` supports the Language Server Protocol
  (LSP), permitting it to be integrated into your favorite
  LSP-compatible editor.  For example, the following screenshot shows
  a snippet of Chapel code within Neovim along with the `chplcheck`
  messages that it generates:

  {{< figure src="chplcheck.png" title="" class="fullwide" >}}

  One of the very cool aspects of `chplcheck` is that it leverages our
  standalone Dyno front-end compiler library via a new set of [Python
  bindings](https://github.com/chapel-lang/chapel/tree/main/tools/chapel-py)
  that have been developed as a means of accessing its features.  The set of
  `chplcheck` rules is also extensible, allowing developers to create
  their own rules (and, ideally, contribute them back to the
  community)!  For more information, please refer to the [`chplcheck`
  documentation](https://github.com/chapel-lang/chapel/tree/main/tools/chplcheck#readme).

  The third tool can be used to find a module's public symbols that
  are lacking documentation.  This has been useful to us in validating
  our documentation for Chapel 2.0, but will also be useful to
  programmers who are creating Chapel libraries or applications and
  relying upon `chpldoc`-based documentation.  In Chapel 1.33, find
  the tool in `tools/chpldoc/findUndocumentedSymbols`.  For
  information on its use, run `findUndocumentedSymbols --help` or see
  the comments at the top of
  [`tools/chpldoc/findUndocumentedSymbols.py`](https://github.com/chapel-lang/chapel/blob/release/1.33/tools/chpldoc/findUndocumentedSymbols.py#L23-L71).

  #### Improved Co-locale Support and Performance Studies

  In the 1.32 release announcement, we described Chapel's recently
  added support for _co-locales_, in which multiple locales can be
  mapped to a single compute node in order to take advantage of
  multiple NICs, or to improve NUMA behavior by giving each locale its
  own socket.  In Chapel 1.33, we have extended support for this
  feature to the `gasnetrun_*` and `slurm-gasnetrun_*` families of
  launchers.

  Since Chapel 1.32, we also gathered an extensive set of Chapel
  performance graphs for various benchmarks running on Slingshot-11
  and InfiniBand systems.  Many of these results demonstrate the
  benefits of co-locales.  For example, the following pair of graphs
  demonstrates the execution-time benefits that running 2 locales per
  node can have for the [ISx benchmark](https://github.com/ParRes/ISx)
  running on (single-NIC) Slingshot-11 and InfiniBand HDR-200 systems
  with dual-socket AMD Milan compute nodes.

  To browse other performance graphs gathered during this survey, see
  the [SS-11 / IB Performance
  Status](https://chapel-lang.org/releaseNotes/1.31-1.32/04-perf-ss11-ib.pdf)
  deck of the [Chapel 1.31 / 1.32 Release
  Notes](https://chapel-lang.org/release-notes-archives.html).  For further
  information on using co-locales with Chapel, please refer to [their
  online
  documentation](https://chapel-lang.org/docs/1.33/usingchapel/multilocale.html#co-locales).


  #### And more...

  Beyond the highlights mentioned here, some other notable features in
  Chapel 1.33 include:

  * improvements to Chapel's [GPU
  support](https://chapel-lang.org/docs/1.33/technotes/gpu.html) in
  terms of generality and library routines,

  * a new prototype
  [breakpoint](https://chapel-lang.org/docs/1.33/modules/standard/Debugger.html)
  routine that can be used to kick a Chapel program into a debugger, and

  * a new
  [fma()](https://chapel-lang.org/docs/1.33/modules/standard/Math.html#Math.fma)
  routine that supports fused multiply-add instructions.
