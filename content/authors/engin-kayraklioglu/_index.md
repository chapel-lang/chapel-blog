Engin is a member of the Chapel team at HPE (formerly Cray Inc.) since
2019. His first brush with Chapel goes back to 2012, where he compared
Chapel against other similar programming languages. He holds a
Ph.D. degree in Computer Engineering from The George Washington
University where his research focus was programmer productivity in
HPC. Since he started working for the Chapel team full-time, he worked
on compiler optimizations and distributed memory performance. He
currently leads the GPU subteam.
