Scott is an oceanographer and climate scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research&nbsp;(USA). He holds an M.S. in Applied Mathematics and a Ph.D. in Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences from the University of Colorado, Boulder, and completed his postdoctoral research at the University of Cambridge (UK). Scott specializes in geophysical fluid dynamics and the development of numerical models used for climate prediction. In particular, he uses a combination of mathematical and physical theory to guide improvements for the ocean component of these models. He is currently a visiting scholar at HPE working with the Chapel team to develop climate science applications using Chapel and the Arkouda library.
